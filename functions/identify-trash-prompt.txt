The following is a json representing a list of trash bins. You have been shown an image containing a piece of trash. Each trash bin in the json has a different purpose. Based on their descriptions, give the ID of the trash bin that the trash in the image should be placed into ("bin_id" parameter). If and only if there are multiple parts of the trash you see in the image which need to be separated into different bins, let the user know in the "more_info" parameter.
