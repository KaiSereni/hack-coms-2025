Create the finalized list of bins to be used based on the report. Create a list of objects, each representing one bin or multiple bins if there is more than one of a certain bin type. Each bin type will have a name and a description of what to include and exclude, as well as a count if there are more than one of the same type of bin. The count parameters should add up to the number of total bins that the user has. If more information is required to make a decision, choose the option that will more likely work for the user.
